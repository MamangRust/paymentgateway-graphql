-- GetTopups: Retrieves paginated list of active topups with search capability
-- Purpose: Provide admin or user access to topup history with search support
-- Parameters:
--   $1: search_term - Optional filter to match card_number, topup_no, topup_method, or status (NULL for no filter)
--   $2: limit - Max number of records to return
